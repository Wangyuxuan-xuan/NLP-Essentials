# NLP-Essentials
This is a note taking repo for class `Essentials in Text and Speech Processing`

The notes are markdown files under each classes folder

Clone this repo and edit your notes as you wish :)

It is recommended to have a paper-based note following [The Cornell Note-Taking Method](https://www.umfk.edu/offices/student-success/successful-note-taking/)  (But maybe not for this class lol)
